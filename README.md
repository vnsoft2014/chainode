<h4 align="center"><em>Fast, Highly Scalable, and Lightweight Private Blockchain Network</em></h4>


Chainode is a private blockchain designed to be fast, lightweight, and highly scalable. The network allows to exchange data (transactions) between trusted participants. These transactions are stored as blocks in a distributed ledger.

Chainode is written in pure Javascript for Node.js, and it is based on Kafka as communication system and block order. Designed for BigData use cases, it is message driven, each peer supports load balancing and is resistant to failures. The Chainode Blockchain is fast, every block is propagated to the network and added to the ledger as soon as it was generated. It is very lightweight being able to run on cheap machines. Every peer provides REST APIs and a Web Console.
